# Gilded Rose PHP

This is [Emily Bache's Gilded Rose](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) with added snapshot testing that covers 100% of the source code. 

Gilded Rose is a great Kata for learning how to set up snapshot testing and code coverage on your machine, but if you want to skip that and get to refactoring you can use this version.

## Getting Started

1. Install the composer packages.
2. Run phpunit to generate the snapshot.
3. Run phpunit again to assert the snapshot stayed the same
